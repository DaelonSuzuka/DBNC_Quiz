I have no idea what the solution to the two columns problem is.

I attempted every encoding scheme and hash algorithm I'm aware of and found no leads.

I attempted to brute force some modulus values and found no leads.

I attempted both of the above with the input as a string and as an integer.

I looked for patterns in the hex and binary representations of the input values, but couldn't find any.

There are a number of contiguous values in the input column, but I wasn't able to make any sort of useful association to thier outputs.

This could be as simple as a custom cipher or particular series of math operators, but the solution space for either is absolutely massive and I don't know any good strategies for narrowing it down.

Whatever this algorithm is, I don't believe it's suitable for serious cryptographic use due to the low entropy of the output, and I have trouble imagining a useful program that would require such a transformation.
