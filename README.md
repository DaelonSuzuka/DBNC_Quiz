# DBNC_Quiz

This repository contains my answers to the DBNC Group Embedded Software Engineer Quiz.

The solution to question 1 was compiled using GCC `11.3.0`. The code is in [question_1.c](question_1.c). My solution does not dynamically allocate memory, and I added additional checks to safely handle certain kinds of pathological input.

I couldn't answer question 2, but I documented my approach and thought process in [question_2.md](question_2.md).
